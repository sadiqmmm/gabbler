# Gabbler

Gabbler is a customizable core to create a Reddit-Like website. It is based on Phoenix and LiveView and provides the UI
to create and maintain Rooms (/r/..), sign on users and post content in a variety of ways. Most functionality and notifications to the user run in real time. Also provided is a service that tracks trends much like Twitter by keeping a sorted list of content organized by the Tags they were posted with.

Previously, Gabbler was a project called Smileys Pub used to learn the Elixir ecosystem. The new goal is to explore LiveView to practice and identify good practices and patterns for a site that can reach a high level of complexity or scale. As new ideas are explored, the codebase will adapt with a priority on setting good standards. It will also adapt quickly as LiveView evolves toward it's official release. There is in fact zero javascript beyond the hook to run LiveView and it will stay that way.

Feedback quite appreciated! And please feel free to raise issues or discuss contributing if interested.

# For Developers

## Up and Running

The default dev setting is to have the Repo project alongside Gabbler Web. Everything else is pretty standard for a Phoenix project.

```
> cd project_dir
> git clone https://github.com/smileys-tavern/gabbler
> git clone https://github.com/smileys-tavern/gabbler_data.git
> cd gabbler
> mix deps.get
> cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development
> mix ecto.migrate
> mix phx.server
```

You should be able to navigate to http://localhost:4000 now


## Development: Update Translations/Gettext
